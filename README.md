- 💻 I’m currently working on my bachelor's in Applied Tech. I've completed certificates in Web Frontend Dev and Databases, and am almost done my certificate in Web Backend. Slight perfectionist tendencies over here, and my grades are almost flawless 🙃

- 👣 Fun fact: I'm also a homeschool mom of 3, going on 8 years now. Best decision ever, wonderful memories behind us, and fantastic times ahead! 

- 🎵 My first degree was in jazz vocal performance, and I'm a classically trained pianist. I used to teach music lessons full time before I had babies. I now maintain a very limited student base (including my own three girls) and focus on producing well-rounded musicians. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make Colombian Empanadas and how to grow veggies in our backyard. 

- 🙌 I speak English with a splash of Spanish and a sprinkling of Korean. 

- 💃 I'm happiest when I'm dancing or reading a great book.
